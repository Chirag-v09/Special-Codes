init
define the variables that carry the data of all types of trained model

FindModel (parameters)
X = X_train
y = y_train
val_X = validation_X
val_y = validation_y
input_shape = provide the input shape of the data
activations_first = provide the activation function of the first hidden layer
activations = provide the activation function for the hidden layers
activation_output = provide the activation function for the output layer
optimizer = which optiomizer u want to use
loss_function = whic loss function
metric = Enter the metric you want to use here in each epoch (list)
essentially provide this metrix ["accuracy"] else you can include of your choice
epochs_num = no. of epochs

layers = no. of layers (list)
neurons = no. of neurons in layers (list)
batch_size = different batch size (list)


SaveModelHistory()
will save the model data i.e 
the loss at each epoch
validation loss at each epoch
accuracy at each epoch
validation accuracy at each epoch

SaveFullHistory()
will save the all the metrix value at each epoch
i.e loss, val loss, acc, val acc and the remaing metric you used in the metirc parameter


LossPlot() and AccPlot()
will plot the graph for the model having the best hyperparameter
