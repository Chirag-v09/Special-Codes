# Here is the module which is created by me in order to find the best hyperparameter or the neural network architecture.

Here it will try many different architecture's of neural networks in different layers as yopu specify the list of layers, list of number of neurons, list of batch size.
Then apply all the possibilities that can be retrieve by them it will return the series of best numbers of layers, neurons, batch size.
